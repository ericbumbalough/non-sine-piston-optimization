# Non-sinusoidal Piston Path Optimization
As a project for a graduate level design optimization class, I modelled the combustion in an engine and optimized the piston path cubic spline for maximum efficiency.
The global maximum minimized time near piston top dead center and timed compbustion to start as the piston descended quickly.
